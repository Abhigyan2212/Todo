# Todo List Application

This project is a simple **Todo List Application** built using **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **MongoDB**. The application allows users to add, view, and delete tasks, each with a title and description. All tasks are stored in **MongoDB**.

## Features

- **Add Todo**: Users can add tasks with a title and description.
- **Delete Todo**: Users can remove tasks from the list.
- **Persistent Storage**: Data is stored in MongoDB, allowing the tasks to persist.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB (MongoDB Compass for database management)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/todo-list.git
cd todo-list
2. Install Dependencies
Make sure you have Node.js installed. Then, run the following command to install all necessary dependencies: npm install
3. Configure MongoDB
Install MongoDB on your system if it isn't installed already. You can either set up a local MongoDB instance or use MongoDB Atlas for a cloud database.

For a local MongoDB instance, use the following URL in your app.js: mongodb://localhost:27017/todo-app
If youâ€™re using MongoDB Atlas, replace it with the appropriate connection string provided by Atlas.

4. Start the Application
After installing dependencies and setting up MongoDB, start the server: node app.js
This will start the server, and you should be able to access the Todo List app at http://localhost:3000.

5. Using the Application
Add a Task: Fill in the form with a title and description, then click the "Add Todo" button to submit the task.
Delete a Task: Click the "Delete" button next to a task to remove it from the list.

Conclusion
This Todo List application provides a basic structure for managing tasks using a simple backend with Node.js and a MongoDB database. It offers the functionality to add, view, and delete tasks, and can easily be extended with more features such as editing tasks or adding due dates.
